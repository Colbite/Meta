# Support
Minehut Meta is **not** the place for obtaining support for Minehut services, your server, plugins, or anything of that nature.

If you would like support, we have a number of resources available:
- **[Help Forum](https://forums.minehut.com/forum/11-help/)**
- **[Minehut Discord](https://discord.gg/minehut)**
- **[Community FAQ](https://forums.minehut.com/forum/790-community-faq/)**
- **[Support Articles](https://superleague.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001333733-Minehut)**
- ***[Contact Minehut Support](https://minehut.com/support/form)***

This is not the place to report bugs with plugins, unless you have tested the plugin on a local server and found different behaviour, in which case you are allowed to report the bug here.

If you are unsure whether you should report a bug here, contact a Minehut staff member [on Discord](https://discord.gg/minehut) or [on the forum](https://forums.minehut.com) and explain your issue.
Additionally, if you have a question about this repository, [read the README](https://github.com/Minehut/Meta) and if your question is still not answered you may [make an issue here](https://github.com/Minehut/Meta/issues/new).
