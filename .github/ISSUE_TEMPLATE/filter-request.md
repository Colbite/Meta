<!-- Minehut filter request guide

Fill out the template. Don't write inside the arrows as they will be hidden
when you post your issue.

If you have a filter request for Minehut, read the following:

1.  Fill out the template
     It makes it a lot easier for everyone when issues conform to the standard templates. It also ensures we have the necessary information. To fill a checkbox, put an "x" in between the [ ] like: [x]

2. Keep the issue title the same as the default provided. Please do not include the filtered phrase in the issue title. 

3. You can delete this line and all the above lines, but they will be hidden anyway    -->
